About DYNAMITE
***************

Here we should present the code and its purpose, explaining what is it doing and why. We should also include useful references.

The **DYNAMITE** (DYnamics, Age and Metallicity Indicators Tracing Evolution) code is a modelling tool for stellar population and dynamical modelling. It is based on an older code for Schwarzschild modelling in triaxial systems which is available `here <https://github.com/dynamics-of-stellar-systems/triaxschwarz>`_. DYNAMITE will extend this old code with a number of new features, including:

* discrete kinematics
* more flexible descriptions of line-of-sight velocity distributions
* population modelling
* smarter steps through parameter space
* GPU acceleration
* more flexible potentials
